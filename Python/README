you will need to copy over this python script which reads the netcdf file and calculates the phase curve:

/home/bd257/Software/python_scripts/calculate_zs2017_phase_curve.py

There are then two ‘control’ python scripts to run this and create the plots:

1) a script that calculates the phase curve and writes it to a file
/home/bd257/Software/python_scripts/calculate_zs17_phase_curves_gj1214.py

In there you can see there are many calls the function calculate_zs17_phase_curve with the various input for each simulation. You’ll need to change the fname and fname_out variables, and also to add in any additional simulations that are not yet included in there (the slow rotator for instance)

You should just be able to run this by running 
python calculate_zs17_phase_curves_gj1214.py
in the directory where the scripts are

2) the second control routine creates the plots:
/home/bd257/Software/plotting_scripts/um_plot_scripts/gj1214_dynamics/plot_gj1214_phase_curves.py

again you just need to change the paths, and add any new simulations that are missing and run it the same as above
python plot_gj1214_phase_curves.py
